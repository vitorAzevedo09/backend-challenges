# Challenge Back-End Ame Digital

Continuing our process, we have a challenge for you! \o/

Our associates are Star Wars fans and so we want to create a game with some information from the franchise.

To enable the front-end team to create this application, we want to develop an API that contains the planets' data.

Requirements:
- The API must be REST
- For each planet, the following data must be obtained from the application database and entered manually:
  - Name
  - Climate
  - Terrain
- For each planet we must also have the number of appearances in films, which can be obtained from the Star Wars public API: https://swapi.co/.

Desired functionalities:
- Add a planet (with name, climate and terrain)
- List planets
- Search by name
- Search by ID
- Remove planet

**Languages we use:** Kotlin, Scala, Java  
**Banks we use:** PostgreSQL-11 with JSONB
